Aiming to achieve finer resolution on COTS devices, 
Xie \etal~\cite{Xie2015Precise} and Zhu \etal~\cite{Zhu:2018fc} 
propose the spectrum stitching technology.
However, they both suffer from the standard Wi-Fi channelization, \ie,
highly restricted spectrum access,
discontinuity in 5GHz band,
and the coarse 5/20MHz channel spacing.
