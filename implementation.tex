\subsection{Unlock UWB Scan on COTS Hardware} % (fold)
\label{sub:unlock_uwb_Scan_access_on_cots}

Atheros ar9300 series and Intel 5300 NICs 
are both available for CSI measurement\cite{csitool, Xie2015Precise}, 
however, for spectrum stitching, ar9300 series has significant advantage.
%
ar9300 series NIC adopt the \textit{soft}-MAC architect, 
\ie, the kernel driver controls the every aspect of the hardware details, 
such as the $cf$ synthesizer, I/Q configuration, \etc.
%
On the contrary, 5300 adopts the \textit{full}-MAC architect, 
\ie, the kernel driver, more like a messenger to the firmware, has much less control over the PHY layer.

Based on the thorough investigation into the kernel driver, 
we successfully override the $cf$ synthesizer control of the ar9300 NIC,
and eventually unlock the complete hardware capability for UWB sensing. 
Table~\ref{tab:cf_tuning_range} details the unlocked hardware characteristics. 

With the unlocked hardware, we can ....;

	\caption*{1. The hardware adopts different signal paths for 2.4/5GHz band, thus the range and resolution are different and they are discontinuous. 2. $Direct$ mode only changes the synthesizer;
	3. $Normal$ mode is the original tuning strategy handling non-cross band case; 4. $Full-Reset$ is the original tuning strategy handling cross-band case. }
